> **60-second summary**
> - Ubuntu/WSL-focused minimal client/server that perform a TLS handshake, then a **HELLO → WORK → info requests → DONE** flow.
> - WORK solved by a fast C++ helper (multi-threaded) invoked from Python.
> - Fully testable: unit tests for protocol/parsing/hashing and mocked SSL/subprocess, generating throwaway certs.

## What this project demonstrates

A small but complete Python client/server application that exercises a real network protocol flow over TLS, with a performance-critical Proof-of-Work step delegated to a compiled C++ helper. The repo is set up like a “real” project: reproducible local/Docker runs, automated tests across Python and C++, type checking, linting/formatting, and Sphinx/Doxygen docs.

- **Backend Python**: CLI-driven client/server built on Python 3.11 (sockets + `ssl`) with structured logging and clear error paths.
- **Interop + performance**: multi-threaded C++20 POW solver (OpenSSL SHA1) invoked from Python via `subprocess`, with path/permission hardening checks.
- **Testing (Python + C++)**: pytest unit + integration coverage (including TLS handshake behavior) plus C++ unit tests via GoogleTest/CTest.
- **Tooling/quality**: pre-commit hooks (ruff/black/isort/codespell), mypy, and GitHub Actions CI.
- **Docs**: Sphinx (Python API from docstrings) + Doxygen/Breathe (C++ API), published via Read the Docs.

## Short demo: server + client solving WORK and answering requests
![Demo](docs/demo.gif)

---

## Short description
This repo implements a small TLS client/server pair that:

- performs a simple line-based handshake (`HELLO` then `WORK`)
- solves a Proof-of-Work challenge where the client must find a suffix so that `SHA256(token + suffix)` has 
a required number of **trailing zero bits**
- answers a sequence of server “info request” commands until `DONE` (or `FAIL`).

The WORK number of bits is configurable (see `--n_bits` on the server). 

More details on how the project works are in the [Guide](docs/guide.md).

## Quickstart
### Download repo
In an Ubuntu/WSL terminal:
```bash
sudo apt install -y git
git clone https://github.com/elliottbache/tls_line_protocol.git
cd tls_line_protocol
```

### Quickstart (recommended): Local (Ubuntu/WSL)
In an Ubuntu/WSL terminal:
```bash
make deps
make setup
make run-server
```
Open another terminal in the same folder and run:
```bash
make run-client
```
That's it, you’ve run the TLS line protocol end-to-end!  Keep reading for a more in-depth 
explanation of what just happened.  

#### Tutorial mode and expected logs
Optional: compare your logs to the expected tutorial run.  If you want a deterministic “known-good” run
you can compare against (useful for demos, onboarding, and quick sanity checks), run the client/server
in **tutorial mode** and compare the produced logs to the committed expected logs.  This can be achieved
by adding the ```FLAGS="--tutorial"``` to ```make run-server``` and ```make run-client``` above.
```bash
# Terminal 1
make run-server FLAGS="--tutorial"

# Terminal 2
make run-client FLAGS="--tutorial"
```
Expected tutorial logs live here:
- `docs/tutorial/server.log`
- `docs/tutorial/client.log`

#### Compare using the provided script
From the repository root:
```bash
bash scripts/compare-tutorial-logs.sh
```

### Quickstart (alternative): Docker
Use this if you prefer Docker.  Otherwise, use the [local quickstart](#quickstart-recommended-local-ubuntuwsl) 
 above.
#### Prepare C++ binary
Run:
```bash
make certs
```
#### Launch Docker daemon
On WSL:
```bash
sudo service docker start
```
On Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

#### Start a docker container
```bash
docker start <name>
```
#### Then run
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Docker Compose uses network_mode: host (Linux/WSL). On Mac/Windows, use local make run-* or adjust 
compose networking/certs.

## Installation (manual, for development or troubleshooting)
If you used [Quickstart (make setup)](#quickstart), you can skip this section.

This package is intended for use in Ubuntu/WSL.  All installation and execution instructions are for these
distributions.  

The quickest and easiest way to install the various components of this package can be found in [Quickstart](#quickstart).
The following steps are for manual installation.
### Create a Python virtual environment with dependencies (skip this if using Docker)
#### System requirements (Ubuntu/WSL):
- **Python**: Python **3.11** + venv support (```python3.11```, ```python3.11-venv```)
- **C++ WORK solver**: CMake **≥ 3.16**, a **C++20** compiler (GCC/Clang), and OpenSSL dev libs (`libssl-dev`)
- **Build tools**: ```build-essential``` (compiler + make)

#### These are installed via:
- ```make deps``` (runs the scripts below), or
- ```bash scripts/install-python-deps.sh``` and ```bash scripts/install-cpp-deps.sh```

Note: if downloaded with wget or as a zip file, the permissions may be lost on the scripts.  In this case,
you may need to change the permissions with ```chmod +x scripts/install-python-deps.sh scripts/install-cpp-deps.sh```.

#### Prefer zero system dependencies?
- Use **Docker** instead (see [Quickstart (alternative): Docker](#quickstart-alternative-docker) below).

#### Create and activate a venv
```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate 
```
#### Install rest of dependencies in venv 
```bash
pip install -U pip
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Compile C++ WORK challenge binary
The C++ code ```work_challenge.cpp``` is used to find a hash with a specified n_bits trailing zero bits.  C++
is used rather than Python due to its speed.
#### Build binary
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```
It can also be compiled directly without 
CMake or the Makefile in an Ubuntu terminal from the ```cpp``` folder, enter:
```bash
mkdir ../build
g++ -O3 -std=c++17 work_challenge.cpp work_core.cpp -o ../build/work_challenge -lssl -lcrypto -pthread
```

#### Move files to binary directory
```bash
mkdir -p src/tlslp/_bin
cp build/work_challenge src/tlslp/_bin/
```

### Create client and server side certificates
#### Easy creation with script
Follow these steps to create the proper certificates for local testing.  These same commands may be found in
```scripts/make-certs.sh```, which can be run with the following:
```bash
bash scripts/make-certs.sh
```

#### Manual certificates creation
A ```certificates``` folder should be created and
these certificates should be placed in the ```certificates``` folder.  The steps are for typing in an Ubuntu terminal from the
project root folder. 
```sh
mkdir certificates
```
```sh
cd certificates
```

##### Client side
###### Create a certificate authority (CA)
```sh
openssl genrsa -out ca_key.pem 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca_key.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -out ca_cert.pem -subj "/CN=My Test CA"

```
This should create ```ca_cert.pem``` and ```ca_key.pem```.

###### Create a client key and certificate signing request (CSR)
```sh
openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 -out ec_private_key.pem
openssl req -new -key ec_private_key.pem -out client.csr -subj "/CN=client"
```
This should create ```client.csr``` and ```ec_private_key.pem```.

###### Sign the client key with the CA
```sh
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca_cert.pem -CAkey ca_key.pem -CAcreateserial -out \
client_cert.pem -days 365 -sha256
```
This creates ```ca_cert.srl``` and ```client_cert.pem```.

##### Server side
###### Prepare the server key and CSR
```sh
openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 2048
openssl req -new -key server-key.pem -out server.csr -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

##### Prepare server certificate signed by CA
```bash
# server cert extensions file
cat > server.ext <<'EOF'
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
keyUsage=digitalSignature,keyEncipherment
extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth
subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1
EOF

# server cert signed by CA
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca_cert.pem -CAkey ca_key.pem -CAcreateserial \
  -out server-cert.pem -days 365 -sha256 -extfile server.ext
```
This creates ```server-cert.pem``` and ```server-key.pem```.   



## Execution / Usage (manual, for development or troubleshooting)
If you used [Quickstart (make setup)](#quickstart), you can skip this section.

This program was developed with Python 3.11.14.  It is intended for use in Ubuntu/WSL, and some of the security 
checks are not available in Windows (such as checking that the WORK challenge binary file launched with 
subprocess.run is not world writable).  

### Option A: No Docker
#### Run server (listens on localhost, verifies client by default)
From within the Python virtual environment (see [Virtual environment](#create-and-activate-a-venv)):
```bash
tlslp-server
```
Various flags are available for running in CLI.  e.g.
```bash
# Run server on localhost:1234 with 6 n_bits
tlslp-server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 1234 \
  --ca-cert certificates/ca_cert.pem \
  --server-cert certificates/server-cert.pem \
  --server-key certificates/server-key.pem \
  --n_bits 6
```
A typical command for development is:
```bash
tlslp-server --log-level DEBUG
```
For a complete list, run
```bash
tlslp-server --help
```

#### In another terminal, run the client
From within th venv:
```bash
tlslp-client
```
Various flags are available for running in CLI.  e.g.
```sh
# For quick localhost development only (skips certificate verification):
tlslp-client --host localhost --ports 1234 \
  --work-bin bin/work_challenge --insecure
```
A typical command for development is:
```bash
# Run client logging all messages
tlslp-client --log-level DEBUG
```
### Option B: Docker
Docker users: see [Quickstart (alternative)](#quickstart-alternative-docker): Docker.

### Compare your output to the expected tutorial logs

Tutorial mode is designed to be deterministic so you can validate behavior by comparing your logs
against committed “golden” logs.

#### Run tutorial manually

In two terminals:
```bash
# Terminal 1
python -m tlslp.server --tutorial

# Terminal 2
python -m tlslp.client --tutorial

# Either terminal
bash scripts/compare-tutorial-logs.sh
```

#### Expected logs (golden files)

The expected tutorial logs are stored in the repository at:

- `docs/tutorial/server.log`
- `docs/tutorial/client.log`

#### Where your local logs are written (Ubuntu/WSL)

On Ubuntu/WSL, this project writes persistent logs under the XDG State directory:

- `XDG_STATE_HOME/tlslp/logs/`

If `XDG_STATE_HOME` is not set, it defaults to:

- `~/.local/state/tlslp/logs/`

So the default log files are:

- `~/.local/state/tlslp/logs/server.log`
- `~/.local/state/tlslp/logs/client.log`

### What is happening?
The client will connect to the server and answer the various commands sent by the server.  The server will first send a
a handshake set of commands (HELLO and WORK).  Once the WORK challenge is solved by the client under 30 minutes, the correct
suffix will be sent to the server and a further 20 random commands will be sent.  If FAIL is randomly selected, the
connection will close.  Otherwise, the final command will be DONE.

## Development
An in-depth description of the modules and functions of this program can be found in the [Read the Docs](https://tls-line-protocol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the [GitHub](https://github.com/elliottbache/tls_line_protocol) page.

### Make commands
A list of make commands is made available through ``Makefile``.  The following list comes from using ``make help``:
- make all: Makes all except run-server and run-client
- make deps: Makes all dependency installation (Python & C++)
- make setup: Makes those needed for initial setup
- make ci: Makes those needed for CI (lint, typecheck, test)
- make clean: Remove caches and build artifacts"
- make venv: Create virtualenv (.venv)
- make install-dev: Install project + dev deps
- make certs: Creates the certificates necessary for mTLS
- make build-cpp: Builds the C++ WORK challenge binary and places it in _bin
- make docs: Build Sphinx HTML docs
- make lint: Run ruff (lint), black --check, isort --check, codespell
- make format: Run ruff --fix, black, isort
- make typecheck: Run mypy
- make test: Run pytest
- make test-cpp: Run CTest
- make run-server: Run server (local)
- make run-client: Run client (local)
- make bench: Quick benchmark for WORK (example)

### Demo GIF
The ```.cast``` file is available for easy regeneration of the GIF file.  The following commands were used 
to create the [GIF](#short-demo-server--client-solving-work-and-answering-requests) from a clean folder.
```bash
asciinema rec -i 3 --overwrite -t "TLSLP demo" -c "tmux new-session -A -s tlslp-demo" demo.cast
git clone https://github.com/elliottbache/tls_line_protocol.git
cd tls_line_protocol/
make setup
# Here we first run the server in this terminal pane (tmux)
# and then open another pane in tmux using <CTRL + B> %
# In normal operation without tmux, you would open another terminal
# and write the client commands in that terminal
make run-server
ctrl + B %
cd tls_line_protocol
make run-client
ctrl + B <-
cat ~/.local/state/tlslp/logs/server.log 
ctrl + B ->
cat ~/.local/state/tlslp/logs/client.log
exit
exit
asciinema-agg demo.cast demo.gif
rm -rf tls_line_protocol
```
The resulting .cast and .gif files must then be copied into the docs/ folder of the original git clone folder.

### Sphinx in PyCharm
In order to create Sphinx documentation from the docstrings in PyCharm, a new run task must be created: 
Run > Edit Configurations... > + (top-left) > Sphinx task.  In the window that opens, name the Sphinx task in the
```Name``` field, select ```html``` under the ```Command:``` dropdown, select the docs folder in the root folder in the ```Input:```
field, and select the docs/_build folder in the ```Output:``` field.  If the docs or docs/_build folder do not already
exist, they will perhaps need to be created.  The Sphinx documentation can now be created by going to Run > Run... and
selecting the Sphinx task name.

### Testing
#### Python code
The Python tests can be run from the repo root with
```bash
pytest -q
```
or with 
```bash
make test
```

#### C++ code
To run the C++ tests, you can simply use
```bash
make test-cpp token=<token> n_bits=<n_bits>
```
where ```token``` is by default "gkcjcibIFynKssuJnJpSrgvawiVjLjEbdFuYQzuWROTeTaSmqFCAzuwkwLCRgIIq",
and n_bits is by default 7.  To run the CTest manually, you can build with:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```
and run with:
```bash
ctest src/tlslp/_bin/work_core_test <token> <n_bits>
```

## Security

This project is a simple demo. The default configuration uses **local, mutual TLS (mTLS)** between 
client and server.  

There is also a flag that allows for basic, unverified TLS to simplify running the sample.

### Basic TLS vs. mTLS

By default, this repo is configured to run in **secure (mTLS)** mode:
- The **server** requires a client certificate (```ssl.CERT_REQUIRED```) and verifies it against 
the configured CA.
- The **client** verifies the server certificate against the configured CA and performs 
hostname/SAN checks.

For quick localhost development, you can run **in insecure mode** using `--insecure`:
- The server does **not** verify client certificates.
- The client does **not** verify the server certificate and disables hostname checks.

**Important:** `--insecure` should only be used for local testing.
